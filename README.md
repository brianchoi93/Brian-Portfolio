## MAJOR HURDLES

Let me start by saying that this entire project was a struggle itself. I have no background in software engineering/coding, so trying to make everything from scratch was extremely difficult...

HTML - Getting the basic layout of the page wasn't too difficult. It did get pretty messy and I did have trouble finding parts of my page, so I had to lable each section of my page, which helped tremendously.

CSS - This probably had to be one of the more challenging parts of the project. Trying to style and having it immediately affected when you begin to style something else. It was difficult. Media query and using flexbox was a major struggle.

Javascript - Javascript being javascript was definitely difficult. It came down to "Do I focus on trying to make my website look neat and prettier?" or "Do I move on to Javascript and make sure I have the necessary functionalites in my website". It was obviously the latter and definitely the right choice. I did struggle with my carousel not changing to previous images, but was able to get that working in the end.
